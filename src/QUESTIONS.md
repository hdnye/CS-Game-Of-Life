   # Explain what cellular automata are & describe how they are useful in the real world
   Cellular automata are a model of computation by which a cell is represented by a finite number of states, depending also on the state of its neighbors,
   as represented by moving figures on a grid of any finite number of dimensions. The cells of the grid are updated simulateously and are all subject to the same rules. 

   # Correctly analyze the ‘Turing Completeness’ of Conway’s “Game of Life”

   # Implement a visualization of Conway’s “Game of Life” using technologies related to their specific track.

   # Utilize "double buffering" to implement the game
