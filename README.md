# CSUnit1Build--GameOfLIfe 

# What is the project? 
    Recreate Classic 2D CS Game.  

# Conway's Game of LIfe Rules
    BS3/SGS23

    Rules:
    - Overpopulation: Any live cell surrounded by 3 ore more living cells dies
    - Static: A live cell lives on to the next generation
    - Underpopultion: A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies
    - Reproduction: Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell

    Instructions:
    - Initialize an empty universe
    - Fill the universe with the seed 
    - Calculate if the current cell survives into the next generation, based on its neighbors
    - Repeat this function over all the cells in the universe
    - Repeat previous 2 steps for each generation     

# What problem does it solve?
   A way to visualize pattern evolution utlizing a simple set of behavioural rules for each cell. In the absence of a predetermined outcome, it shows emergence and self-organization are possible w/o prior design or programming
